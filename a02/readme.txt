Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues


/******************************************************************************
 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why? 
 *
 *  We chose to do the array because it seemed more straight forward to us.
 *  We understood why and when I had to change the array, and how to do it. That's
 *  why we chose it.
 *****************************************************************************/


/******************************************************************************
 *  How much memory (in bytes) do your data types use to store n items
 *  in the worst case? Use the 64-bit memory cost model from Section
 *  1.4 of the textbook and use tilde notation to simplify your answer.
 *  Briefly justify your answers and show your work.
 *
 *  Do not include the memory for the items themselves (as this
 *  memory is allocated by the client and depends on the item type)
 *  or for any iterators, but do include the memory for the references
 *  to the items (in the underlying array or linked list).
 *****************************************************************************/

Randomized Queue:   ~  42N + 24 bytes

Deque:              ~  24N + 42  bytes




/******************************************************************************
 *  Known bugs / limitations.
 *****************************************************************************/


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
 *  Don't include readings, lectures, and precepts, but do
 *  include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
 *	
 *	The only help we received was help that we got in class on the subset.java.
 *	The instructions were rather vauge on how the class should be implemented,
 *	so we're happy that was clarified for us.
 *****************************************************************************/



/******************************************************************************
 *  If you worked with a partner, assert below that you followed
 *  the protocol as described on the assignment page. Give one
 *  sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
 *
 *	We both contributed to the assignment equally, it's hard to put in a single
 *  sentence what we did individually, but if we're speaking about things we did
 * 	completely on our own, Spencer did the Iterators and Gerald did the JUnit tests.
 *****************************************************************************/



/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 *
 *	We didn't encounter too many serious problems worth mentioning.
 *****************************************************************************/



/******************************************************************************
 *  List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback   
 *  on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether    
 *  you enjoyed doing it.  
 
 * We really enjoyed working and figuring out how to make our own iterators, as well
 * as learning about what a deque is.
